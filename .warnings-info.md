# Warnings Information

This document explains the warnings you may see when running the development server.

## 1. Lockfile Warning

**Warning Message:**
```
⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Users\admin\OneDrive\Documents\pnpm-lock.yaml as the root directory.
```

**Cause:** Next.js detected a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file in the parent directory and is confused about which project root to use.

**Solution:** 
- The `next.config.mjs` file has been configured with `turbopack.root` to explicitly set the project root.
- If the warning persists, you can safely ignore it - it doesn't affect functionality.
- Alternatively, you can move or rename the parent directory's `pnpm-lock.yaml` if it's not needed.

**Status:** Configured in `next.config.mjs` - warning may still appear but is harmless.

## 2. Middleware Deprecation Warning

**Warning Message:**
```
⚠ The "middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead.
```

**Cause:** This is a Turbopack-specific warning. Next.js 16 Turbopack shows this warning, but `middleware.ts` is still the correct and standard way to implement middleware.

**Solution:**
- **No action needed** - `middleware.ts` is the correct file name and convention.
- This warning is a known Turbopack quirk and can be safely ignored.
- The middleware functionality works perfectly despite this warning.

**Status:** Safe to ignore - middleware is implemented correctly.

## Summary

Both warnings are **harmless** and do not affect the functionality of your application. They are informational warnings from Next.js 16 Turbopack and can be safely ignored during development.
